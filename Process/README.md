## Thursday, January 23, 2025: Make a Thing

I was really stumped when trying to figure out what kind of game I wanted to make. Before I realized we had to use the engines given to us, I thought of making a “wack-a-mole” type game using javascript p5.

When looking through the different game making tools, I settled on Ink for a few reasons:

1.	I checked the basic tutorial before downloading it and the “coding” was quick and easy to understand.
2.	I enjoy writing stories, so this would be a fun exercise to test how I’d do with writing one.

Obviously, I couldn’t write an entire story, and I had to have enough to explore the main mechanics.

I decided to use the concept I had for a story where a demon king takes a human girl as a bride in order to gain control of the surface world through this union and it’s up to the girl’s best friend to save her.

I started writing with the intent of only writing a “first chapter” as a sort of way of starting a story and leaving it open ended.

I wrote up until the “pathway vs forest” choice and decided it would be easier if I make a map of all possible choices and have them meet up in certain places.

I ended up removing one of the option selections in the final product, mainly to save time for the project. I made it so that most choices get you to the same ending but still added some alternative endings to add some variety.

I wrote the rest of my text in a Google Document because it would be easy to write in my spare time. I pasted it into my file and fixed some of the coding mistakes I’ve made.

I made sure to add conditions, so that depending on the choices the player makes, the dialogue might change.

I kept my writing simple and to the point in most cases, while still adding a small twist of humor to it and making the narrator a bit sassy. If I had more time to explore this tool, I would have definitely loved to see what other choices I could give to the player.
